                    <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Imagery to me is the opportunity to share my perspective with the world. I do the usual engagement with imagery, social media, phone photos, etc, but I also have specialities that other may not. Specifically, I engage in a lot of cinematography and film work, and this is where I excel. I founded a production studio back at home (Kittery Point, Maine) and work on it with a few of my colleagues. I rely on imagery because it literally is part of my job and career. I want to continue to professionally create imagery in the future.
<br>If I had to be in a gallery to show off my work, I would like it to be alongside other cinema creators. I few I personally like is Corridor Digital,  Freddie Wong because of their online presence, but there are many other creators out there who do remarkable work and that I aspire to be like.
<br>Most associate imagery with images / pictures, which isn’t wrong, but movies and animations are also a form of imagery, and the ones that I most associate myself with. Videos are still images, just usually twenty four of them a second. Technically, that might mean that videos have more imagery than a single image. I can confidently say the film defines me as a person, I think about it all the time, I love creating with it, and most of all I enjoy sharing my perspectives on life with other people. Allowing someone to see through someone else’s shoes, and to realize a world outside of their own, is in my opinion the best part of film. There are many aspects of film and I enjoy doing all of them, but for this class I can focus more in on the cinematography aspects because, well, this is an Image class.&nbsp;<br></p>

                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cyborg.batman" target="_blank" class="text-success"><em>Instagram Account Link</em></a><br>So this is the first 5th-week checkpoint of a 15-week visual diary on instagram. I decided at the very beginning of this whole thing that I wanted some kind of constant in all the photos. When I looked back on everyone’s examples from previous semesters, I realized that they were all over the place. Yeah, they had their weekly themes, but if you had an ongoing daily theme, if could keep users engaged and get more attention. Not that I cared very much about how many people my posts reached, but I thought it would be cool nonetheless. So, I started the Lego Cyborg Batman instagram account. Specifically, “cyborg.batman”. “Why?” you ask. Why not.
<br>	Starting out, it was as you would expect. 1 like here, another like there. I originally had narrative writing to go along with a post, in the first person as batman. That idea didn’t really stick so it didn’t last long. It wasn’t long before I wanted to gain more of an audience. So I decided to do what any other rational person would do; follow and follow and follow and… you get the idea. Right now I’m sitting on 64 followers and following 509 people. Obviously you can only do this once per person, but it does help you numbers get up there while you’re still gaining attention.
<br>	Anyway, my first big post was the 7th, a week in. Obviously it was, because I took a picture of lego cyborg batman in Vail while I was snowboarding. 21likes, a few comments. I’m going to be honest, I haven’t reached any else that high, but it's not easy to just drive to Vail everyday. And I can only care about a lego batman instagram so much… However, what I can report is that my average likes have been increasing and my followers have been going up, at least recently.
<br>	I’m still unsure if there are many correlations with the data that I took. My process for collecting data was to write down all the post info one day, and the next day write it likes / comments count. So I was always checking a day behind, everyday, as 90% of the engagement with a post is same day. The biggest thing that stood out to me was that anything outdoors and mountains was favored more. I think that’s just a given because it looks cool. Any creative posts and garbage posts are about on the same page, never more than 10 likes. I don’t mind it, but it is a little annoying when I work hard to take a picture and nobody appreciates it.
<br>	Now let me tell you about the figure. It’s a long story but I got the Lego Batman keychain as a joke from a friend, and it was on my backpack until I removed it for this account. I went ahead and took off the keychain bits, and because it was so old, I decided to make it “cyborg”. He lost his arm at some point, so I made him a new prosthetic one out of a screw and paperclips. Then I colored one of his eyes red (the eyes light up with a button press so this looks cool). So yeah, he was pretty beaten up at the start and now… yikes. I put him in water for a while for one post, I’m surprised the electronics still work. I put him in the oven for another post, and forgot to take him off… so his legs are a bit melted and the cape burnt off, if you’re wonder what happened to it. I might make him another one soon. His light button got stuck in the on position, so now I have to take in and out the batteries, which is kinda annoying. At the end of the day though, it’s all in good fun.
<br>	I plan on keeping up with what I’m doing, and making some more changes to the figure, to keep things interesting. I hope that I can continue to create good ideas and photos. Some of the week topics were a drag, but I’m enjoying light and dark right now. <br>

But that is probably going to be a given with anyone doing this assignment for school. Posting everyday just gives you this feeling of creative burnout, at least for me. In the past I’ve done a lot of video and film projects, and because of the sheer size and effort of those, I need like a month or two to regain my creative thinking. With something like this, that burnout happens slower, but is still there. I think part of it might have to be with my methods approaching this project. I’m posting an image everyday of this LEGO Batman character, and there is only so many things you can do with him. Obviously it helps with the weekly themes changing, but right now it feels the worst, mostly because I’m on break and also I haven’t done much of my project, which is this [two] week’s theme.
<br>Anyways, back to using Instagram. I’ve had an account with them for probably 5 years (man I can’t believe it’s been that long) but I’ve never really felt burnout like this. Looking back on my main account’s postings, I usually only posted a few times a week at most, which could be why I never really felt like I do now with the Batman account. That frequency sometimes dropped to once a month at times, over the course of my history with Instagram. I definitely remember being way more into it when I was younger, but things have changed and my social activity on certain platforms have adjusted over time.
<br>To be honest, Instagram is kind of a terrible. I’m not just specifying this argument specifically towards this one platform, just using it as an example. People really don’t wanna share the bad parts of their lives online, so all you ever see when you log onto Instagram is workout pics, travel pics, fun pics, stuff like that. Never the divorce, the crying, the stress, the pain, everything there is just happy, all the time. It’s almost nauseating. Obviously this is not always the case with instagram posts, but there is just so much of it, it can make someone feel terrible about their own life, like they are not doing enough with it. I’ve been on both sides of this myself. Unfortunately that’s just what happens when you have a social media platform based solely on photos. I just don’t see myself using instagram that often going forward, not really because of using is so heavily for this project, but instead mostly for my self-esteem.
<br>At the end of the day, I want to use instagram to express my work a myself, but I don’t want to rely on it just to get justification in what I am doing. I have to determine that for myself before hear others’ feedback, not the other way around.<br></p>
